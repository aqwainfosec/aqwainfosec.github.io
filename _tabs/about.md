Hi, I'm Aqwa and I like to break things (in a good way)! I'm a final year cybersecurity student currently preparing for the CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) and CRTA (Certified Red Team Analyst) certifications. This is a simple blog where I post Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge write-ups and, humbly, some writings related to my security research. This blog serves as a means to document my learning journey and express my passion for security.

## Certifications
- [eJPTv2 (Junior Penetration Tester)](https://certs.ine.com/f56257a2-0d9f-4284-9e77-eb92b95739fb)
- CRTA (in progress)
