Hi, I'm Aqwa and I like to break things (in a good way)! I'm a third-year cybersecurity student currently preparing for the eJPTv2 certification. This is a simple blog where I post Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge write-ups and, humbly, some writings related to my security research. This blog serves as a means to document my learning journey in the world of security.
